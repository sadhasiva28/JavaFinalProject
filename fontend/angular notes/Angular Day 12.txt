1. install json: npm install -g json-server[need to do outside of project]
2. check whether it is installed : json-server in cmd
3. run in cmd: json-server --port 4500 mypro.json

 

---to reuse the functions called into components is done using service----

 

we import the data from rest api in data flow format:

 

Data flow: api call --> service --> parent component --> child component

................................................................................
First creating the contact services
-->for the working of Http client we import the Http client module without the 
http client module the http client will not work 
-->by using of http client we can 
1)get
2)post
....etc
--->after getting the output the observable :-it's like promise method
in the RXJS 
-->THE observable works similar to the promise method
-->but observable can get results from the function n times
-->you can subscribe to the observable
-->in promise method whether success or reject like in observable next or error
--->in promise method we using the function called then for calling the method like wise
we call as in observable as subcribe
..................................................................
dependency injection

dependecy:-changing one class it will impact other class is called as dependecy
ex:-class A- m1
    class B -m2
    class A2-m1
class c- main
your project 
class c -main{
//creating object for m1 in class 
A obj=newA()
   obj.m1
}

ex:- feature 1-->A
feature 2-->B
feature 2-->A2
class A- m1
    class B -m2
    class A2-m1
class c- main
your project 
class c -main{
//creating object for m1 in class 
feature1 obj=newA()
   obj.m1
}
here importing the framework of the components
if the version is changes it won't fill the code , it automatically
correct the code by import the object calling from another
