Directives
    
         <h2 bgcolour="">
         custom elements or attributes created using angular are called as
Directives

components Directives
this are custom directives
1)structural Directives
2)attributes Directives

1)structural Directives
->these directives generate template or hide/unhide templates
->all structural in angular must be prefixed with *(asterisk)
->we have few inbuilt structural directives and if needed
->we can also create custom structural Directives
->some inbuilt structural Directives-ngfor,ngIf,ngSwitch

2)attributes Directives

attributes directives changes the behaviour of the target element[
style ,data]

there are three kinds of attributes directives

input directives
->changes behaviour of the target element
 - usually these directives are enclosed within []
		   - It receives value from the right side and usually
		   in the right side we mention objects
		   
		    <h1 [sample]="test"></h1>
			
			here sample is input directives
			test is input value [variable]
			note: test is not string , test is a variable
			
			<h1 sample = "test"></h1>
			
			in this case, sample is input directives
			and test is not a variable it is a string
			
    inbuilt input directives: ngClass,ngStyle,style, routerLink,
    formControlName....
			
			

	   output directives

        - output directives are event listeners
        - upon event they will call the functions that
        are mentioned in the right side
        - output directives are enclosed with paranthesis ()

        some inbuilt output directives: click, change, keyup,keydown
        , mouseover

        ex: <button (click)="fun()"></button>

	   input output directives
  

     It works bidirectional
     it does work of both input and output directives
     there is only one widely used input output directive called
     ngModel

     to use ngModel we need to import a module called FormsModule

     how it works?

     usually we use ngModel in form elements

     <input type="text" [(ngModel)]="firstname">

     if firstname has value Raj ..raj will be filled in the textbox

     if you type Rahul in the textbox it will stored to firstnam
