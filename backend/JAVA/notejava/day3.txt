the parent class is sub class of the child
like example:
singlar is a interface
plular is a class
interface eextends 
---------------------------------------
in the samplepro 
the parent is employee 
and the child is manager

we can create the separate objects for each of the class
we can access the all manager in employee 
like this Employee ng=new Manager(); it is true

here the instanceof if else condition is applied
--------------------------------------
here the static entities will be loaded to memory only once
-->static entities are the first entity to be loaded

-->to invoke static entities,we dont require an object

abstraction:-
the abstract is the hide the internal progress and it's shows the useful to the user
in this we can use the abstrat method for the following class
-------------------------------------------------
java is not a framework it is a api
it used for the pre-defined
