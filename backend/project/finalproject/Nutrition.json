As a general guideline, the Institute of Medicine recommends that men aim for about 3.7 liters (125 ounces) of total water intake per day, while women aim for about 2.7 liters (91 ounces) per day. This includes water from all sources, including beverages and food. However, it's important to note that individual needs may vary and it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized recommendations.",
        "A good way to gauge if you're getting enough water is to check the color of your urine - it should be pale yellow to clear. If it's darker, that could be a sign that you need to drink more water.",
        "It's also important to remember that thirst is not always a reliable indicator of hydration status. By the time you feel thirsty, you may already be dehydrated. That's why it's important to drink water regularly throughout the day and not just when you feel thirsty."
