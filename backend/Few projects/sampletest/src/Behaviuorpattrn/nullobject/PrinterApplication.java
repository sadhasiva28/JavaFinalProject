/*
 * In this example, we have an interface called Printer that defines a method
 * called print. We also have a concrete implementation of the Printer interface
 * called ConsolePrinter that prints the document to the console. Finally, we
 * have a Null Object implementation of the Printer interface called NullPrinter
 * that does nothing.
 * 
 * In the PrinterApplication class, we have a method called getPrinter that
 * returns either null (to use the ConsolePrinter) or a new instance of the
 * NullPrinter (to use the Null Object). The main method calls getPrinter to get
 * an instance of the Printer interface, and then calls its print method with a
 * string argument.
 * 
 * If we were to call getPrinter and it returned null, the print method would
 * throw a NullPointerException. However, if we were to call getPrinter and it
 * returned a new instance of NullPrinter, the print method would do nothing and
 * the application would continue running without any errors.
 * 
 * Overall, the Null Object pattern can help to prevent null pointer exceptions
 * in Java applications and provide a more robust and reliable application.
