/*
 *
 The Builder pattern is commonly used when we need to create complex objects with many optional parameters, and when we want to create these objects using a fluent and readable API. 
 Here are some real-time use cases where the Builder pattern can be useful:

Creating a Configuration Object: 
When creating a configuration object for an application or system, 
the Builder pattern can be used to 
set all the various configuration options in a fluent and readable way.

Creating a Database Query Object: When creating a database query object, 
the Builder pattern can be used to 
set all the various query parameters in a fluent and readable way. 
This makes it easier to create complex queries
 with many optional parameters.

Creating a GUI Component: When creating a complex GUI component, 
the Builder pattern can be used to
 set all the various configuration options in a fluent and readable way. 
 This makes it easier to create 
 complex GUI components with many optional parameters.

Creating an Email Object: When creating an email object, the Builder pattern can be used to set all 
the various parameters such as the email subject, sender, recipient, body, attachments, etc. in a fluent 
and readable way.

In general, the Builder pattern is useful in any situation where you need 
to create an object with many optional parameters, 
and you want to make the process of setting those parameters as easy and 
readable as possible.
