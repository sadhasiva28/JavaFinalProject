SPRING BOOT PROJECT
first create the string application project from the spring (spring initializr io) add maven etc,
--download and open in the eclipse
--open resources and connect to the database so the what data give in the spring boot in will goes into the database
--Know create the package like main method and contoller,entities(model),repository,if needed exceptions
--In the model package what are the involves character we need to defined and create the getter and setter methods etc...
--Main think is remove or commit the src/test/java if not u will get the error for this 
--The connection between the spring boot project and angulalr u want to add this lines in the controller 
--@CrossOrigin(origins = "http://localhost:4200")
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/v1/")
--this is the localhost linked to the spring boot and the angular application 
--In the api is empty we can post the data by using postman and set the data and get the data
--It well reflect in the oracle sql also
--In controller multiple action is to be done example:- sort,edit or update ,delete ,view ect, done in the controller


ANGULAR APPLICATION 
First create the angular project with what the name we want and do npm install bootstrap
and add this line in the index.html
 <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.0.0/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" 
        integrity="sha384-Gn5384xqQ1aoWXA+058RXPxPg6fy4IWvTNh0E263XmFcJlSAwiGgFAW/dAiS6JXm" crossorigin="anonymous">
                        or
add this line in style.css
@import "~bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css";

--so,that i will integrate the bootstrap in the angular connection.
--The connect between the components it should be proper and it should work (router)
--This is i have created the employee-list for that i have created the service and connected both with the localhost link
--



CONNECTION SPRING BOOT AND ANGULAR:
--In the spring boot controller important is adding the
@CrossOrigin(origins = "http://localhost:4200")-- it should what localhost u are runing the application this is important
@RestController-- this like manditory for the controller 
@RequestMapping("/api/v1/")--This is like getting the data from the server it may be the api or json server etc.. it should be mention.
--While runing the angular application the backend should run the application mean while orcale or mysql to check the data whether storing are not
